# Magneto
Code used in data analysis for Astro Pi Mission Space Lab Phase 4

The first three scripts plot graphs from the gathered data. (Some of the graphs might not have made it to the final report, due to the limited number of pages)
The 4th script is regression analysis script with which we minimised the difference between the model and the gathered data.
The last script (5th) plots the generated magnetic field intensity from the model into a contour map, adds the ISS trajectory and also returns the position of the magnetic poles.
